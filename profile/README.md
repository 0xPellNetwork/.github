# Pell Network

## Decentralized DeFAI Infrastructure with Cross-Chain Composability

Pell Network unlocks new value through innovative restaking mechanisms and AI-driven optimization, building a trustless, permissionless infrastructure layer that enables interoperability and value transfer across all major smart contract blockchains (including Ethereum, Solana, Avalanche, and others).

### Our Mission

Building the first truly decentralized "security-intelligence-data" protocol that empowers users with self-sovereign financial tools while fostering interoperability across the Web3 ecosystem.

### Core Products

**Megapool**: Decentralized AI-powered restaking protocol that maximizes capital efficiency, delivering triple-layered yields (base + restaking + DeFi) for token holders while maintaining full custody of assets.

**DVS System**: Trustless validation infrastructure enabling cross-chain communication and computation. Utilizes cryptoeconomic security through restaked assets, with transparent, on-chain governance and fair distribution of rewards to Network Operators.
